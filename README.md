ring-around-the-polygon
=======================

Messing with some Common Lisp to simulate creating rings of of identical polygons with mutations on their edges.
I'd like to know how many rings can be made with bumps/divots in many variations around the center polygon.

The interesting cases are those which are not infinite.

Using svgs because, on the small scale, it will help the user/mathematician visualize the situation.
